# Large Weekend Sales Percentage Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a SQL view that calculates the percentage of large sales occurring on weekends for each month. It addresses the need to understand sales patterns and identify periods when significant transactions are more likely to happen outside regular business days.

## Case Studies 📊💼

- 🏪 Retail Stores: Analyze if promotional weekends drive larger purchases
- 🏢 Real Estate: Determine if high-value property sales occur more on weekends
- 🍽️ Restaurants: Assess if weekend diners tend to spend more
- 🛍️ E-commerce: Evaluate weekend vs. weekday purchasing behavior for big-ticket items

## Generic Code

```sql
CREATE VIEW percentage_large_sales_weekends AS
WITH avg_sales AS (
    SELECT AVG(sale_value) * [multiplier] AS large_sale_threshold
    FROM [sales_table]
),
categorized_sales AS (
    SELECT s.*,
           c.is_weekend,
           c.[time_period], 
           CASE 
               WHEN s.sale_value > a.large_sale_threshold THEN 1
               ELSE 0
           END AS is_large
    FROM [sales_table] s
    JOIN [calendar_table] c ON s.[date_key] = c.[date_key]
    CROSS JOIN avg_sales a
)
SELECT 
    cs.[time_period],
    COALESCE(
        SUM(CASE WHEN is_large = 1 AND is_weekend = '[weekend_indicator]' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / 
        NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN is_weekend = '[weekend_indicator]' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0), 
        0) AS pct_large_sales_weekends
FROM categorized_sales cs
GROUP BY cs.[time_period];
```

## Example of Code

```sql
CREATE VIEW porcentaje_ventas_grandes_fines_de_semana AS
WITH promedio_ventas AS (
    SELECT AVG(valor_venta) * 1.3 AS umbral_venta_grande
    FROM VENTA
),
ventas_grandes AS (
    SELECT v.*,
           c.es_fin_de_semana,
           c.mes, 
           CASE 
               WHEN v.valor_venta > p.umbral_venta_grande THEN 1
               ELSE 0
           END AS es_grande
    FROM VENTA v
    JOIN CALENDARIO c ON v.sk_fecha = c.sk_fecha
    CROSS JOIN promedio_ventas p
)
SELECT 
    g.mes,
    COALESCE(
        SUM(CASE WHEN es_grande = 1 AND es_fin_de_semana = 'T' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / 
        NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN es_fin_de_semana = 'T' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0), 
        0) AS pct_ventas_grandes_fines_de_semana
FROM ventas_grandes g
GROUP BY g.mes;
```

## Notes

- Adjust the `[multiplier]` value (currently 1.3) to define what constitutes a "large" sale for your business context.
- Modify `[sales_table]`, `[calendar_table]`, and column names to match your database schema.
- Ensure the `[weekend_indicator]` matches the value used in your calendar table to denote weekends.
- The `[time_period]` can be changed to analyze different time granularities (e.g., week, quarter) instead of month.
- Consider adding appropriate indexes on join columns and filtering conditions for better performance.
