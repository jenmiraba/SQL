# Simulating Materialized Views in MySQL

&nbsp;
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to simulate materialized views in MySQL using tables and stored procedures. While MySQL does not natively support materialized views like other databases (e.g., PostgreSQL or Oracle), this approach allows to achieve similar functionality by storing the results of complex queries in a physical table. These results can be refreshed periodically to keep them up-to-date.

&nbsp;
## Case Studies
**Why simulate materialized views in MySQL?**

This technique is especially useful in scenarios where:
- You perform complex joins, aggregations, or calculations.
- The data changes infrequently and does not require real-time updates.
- Performance optimization is critical, such as in reporting or analytics systems.
&nbsp;
## Code

Below is a generic structure for simulating a materialized view using MySQL stored procedures. You will need:
- A table (`materialized_view_table`) to store the results.
- A source table (`source_table`) to extract data from.
- A stored procedure to handle the refresh of the materialized data.
&nbsp;
### Steps in the procedure:
1. Clear the existing data in the `materialized_view_table`.
2. Insert new, precomputed data from the `source_table` using a custom query.

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE refresh_materialized_view(OUT result_code INT)
BEGIN
    -- Step 1: Clear existing data
    TRUNCATE TABLE materialized_view_table;

    -- Step 2: Insert new data
    INSERT INTO materialized_view_table (column_1, column_2, aggregate_metric)
    SELECT 
        source_column_1, 
        source_column_2, 
        SUM(source_metric) AS aggregate_metric
    FROM 
        source_table
    GROUP BY 
        source_column_1, source_column_2;

    -- Output a result code if needed
    SET result_code = 0;
END
//
DELIMITER ;
```
&nbsp;
## Example of Code
Here is an example of how you could implement this for a sales commission system, where we need to calculate and store the commission for each sales person by date.


```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE refresh_sales_commissions(OUT result INT)
BEGIN
    -- Step 1: Clear existing commission data
    TRUNCATE TABLE sales_commissions;

    -- Step 2: Calculate and insert new commissions
    INSERT INTO sales_commissions (customer_id, sale_date, commission_amount)
    SELECT 
        salesperson_id, 
        sale_date, 
        SUM(sale_amount * 0.10) AS commission_amount
    FROM 
        sales_data
    GROUP BY 
        salesperson_id, sale_date;

    -- Set result code
    SET result = 0;
END
//
DELIMITER ;
```

In this example:

The procedure calculates a 10% commission on all sales (sale_amount * 0.10).
The results are grouped by salesperson_id and sale_date, and then inserted into the sales_commissions table. 
&nbsp;
## Notes
- Ensure the target table (e.g., materialized_view_table or sales_commissions) already exists before running the procedure. 
- Modify the table, column names and your query to suit your requirements.
- You can set up a scheduled event in MySQL to automatically refresh the materialized view at regular intervals (e.g., daily, hourly).
- If using for real-time data, consider implementing triggers on your source table to refresh the view as the data is updated.

``` sql
CREATE EVENT refresh_sales_commissions_event
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
DO
CALL refresh_sales_commissions(@result);
```

With this approach, you can achieve the performance benefits of materialized views in MySQL, even without native support.
