# Calendar Table Generation Stored Procedure

## Overview

This repository contains a MySQL stored procedure for generating a comprehensive calendar dimension table. The procedure populates a table with dates and various date-related attributes, which is crucial for time-based analysis in data warehousing and business intelligence applications, which will allow for easy querying of date-related information and facilitates time-based analysis across various granularities (day, month, quarter, year).

## Code

```sql
# Stored Procedure
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE program_sql.CREA_CALENDARIO(IN startdate DATE, IN stopdate DATE)
BEGIN
    DECLARE currentdate DATE;
    SET currentdate = startdate;
    
    WHILE currentdate <= stopdate DO
        INSERT INTO program_sql.CALENDARIO VALUES (
           YEAR(currentdate)*10000+MONTH(currentdate)*100 + DAY(currentdate),  -- Primary key: YYYYMMDD
           currentdate,                                                         -- Full Date
           YEAR(currentdate),                                                   -- Year
           MONTH(currentdate),                                                  -- Month
           DAY(currentdate),                                                    -- Day
           QUARTER(currentdate),                                                -- Quarter
           WEEKOFYEAR(currentdate),                                             -- Week of the Year
           DATE_FORMAT(currentdate,'%W'),                                       -- Day of the Week (Text)
           DATE_FORMAT(currentdate,'%M'),                                       -- Month (Text)
           'f',                                                                 -- Placeholder Field (modifiable)
           CASE DAYOFWEEK(currentdate) WHEN 1 THEN 't' WHEN 7 THEN 't' ELSE 'f' END -- Weekend flag
        );
        SET currentdate = ADDDATE(currentdate, INTERVAL 1 DAY);
    END WHILE;
END
//
DELIMITER ;
```

# Execute the stored procedure
```sql
CALL program_sql.CREA_CALENDARIO('2010-01-01','2030-01-01');
```

# Optimize the table
```sql
OPTIMIZE TABLE program_sql.CALENDARIO;
```

## Notes

- Adjust the schema name (`program_sql`) and table name (`CALENDARIO`) to match your database structure.
- Modify the date range in the `CALL` statement to generate the desired period of dates.
- The `date_key` is created as a numeric representation (YYYYMMDD) for easy sorting and querying.
- The procedure uses 't' for true and 'f' for false in boolean fields. You may want to adjust this to suit your preferences (e.g., using 1 and 0, or 'Y' and 'N').
- Consider adding indexes to frequently queried columns for improved performance.
- You can extend the table structure to include additional date attributes as needed for your specific use case (e.g., fiscal year, holidays, etc.).
