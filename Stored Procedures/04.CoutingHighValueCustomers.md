# Counting High-Value Customers in MySQL

&nbsp;
## Overview
This project contains a stored procedure for counting high-value customers in MySQL. A high-value customer is defined as one whose total sales exceed a certain threshold, which is provided as input when calling the procedure. The result is returned as the count of customers who meet this criterion. This procedure is useful for analyzing customer behavior and identifying top customers, and can be integrated into larger data processing pipelines or reporting systems.

&nbsp;
## Case Studies
**Why use this stored procedure for counting high-value customers?**

- **Sales Analysis**: By quickly counting the number of customers who have generated sales above a certain threshold, we can focus on the most profitable clients.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: The sales threshold is adjustable, making this procedure flexible for different use cases (e.g., defining "high-value" customers for marketing or loyalty programs).
- **Chained Processes**: This procedure can be part of a series of chained database processes, where the output (the count of high-value customers) is used as input for another process, such as determining resource allocation or generating reports for specific customer segments.

This procedure is ideal for:
- Analyze high-value customers as part of larger ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- Data changing frequently, and up-to-date counts for reporting or decision-making are needed.

## Code

The following stored procedure counts customers whose total sales exceed a specified threshold (`ventas_min`).

&nbsp;
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE my_database.SP_count_high_value_customers(
    IN min_sales INT,                           -- Minimum sales threshold
    OUT high_value_customers_count INT          -- Total number of high-value customers
)
BEGIN
    -- Count customers whose total sales exceed the minimum threshold
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    INTO high_value_customers_count
    FROM (
        SELECT S.customer_id, SUM(S.sales_value) AS total_sales
        FROM my_database.SALES AS S
        JOIN my_database.CUSTOMER AS C 
        ON S.customer_id = C.customer_id
        GROUP BY S.customer_id
        HAVING total_sales > min_sales
    ) AS high_value_customers;

END
//
DELIMITER ;
```
&nbsp;

## Calling the Procedure

```sql
-- Call the procedure with a sales threshold of $1,000
CALL my_database.SP_count_high_value_customers(1000, @total_high_value_customers);

-- Retrieve the result (number of high-value customers)
SELECT @total_high_value_customers;
```

&nbsp;
## Notes

- Modify the table, column names and your query to suit your requirements.
- You can set up a scheduled event in MySQL to automatically refresh the count at regular intervals (e.g., daily, hourly), ensuring that the count of high-value customers is always up to date.


## Schedule procedure
``` sql
CREATE EVENT daily_high_value_customers_count
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
STARTS '2025-09-20 00:00:00'
DO
CALL my_database.SP_count_high_value_customers(1000, @total_high_value_customers);
```
