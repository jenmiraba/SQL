# Identifying High-Value Customers in MySQL

&nbsp;
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a stored procedure in MySQL to identify high-value customers based on their total sales. By calculating the total sales for each customer and storing those who exceed a specified threshold in a separate table, this procedure helps to quickly access the most valuable customers in the business.

This is especially useful for businesses looking to analyze customer behavior or optimize targeting for high-revenue customers.

&nbsp;
## Case Studies
**Why use this stored procedure for customer analytics in MySQL?**

- **Data Aggregation**: Summarizing sales data for each customer allows businesses to focus on high-value clients, which are often the most critical for growth and sustainability. 
- **Efficient Filtering**: Rather than repeatedly running expensive queries on the entire dataset, you can store precomputed high-value customers in a dedicated table for faster retrieval. 
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: The stored procedure allows you to define a dynamic sales threshold, making it adaptable to different use cases (e.g., identifying customers with sales over $1,000 or $10,000). 

This procedure is especially useful in scenarios where:
- You have large datasets and need to regularly analyze the top-performing customers.
- The sales data changes frequently, and you want to maintain an updated list of key customers.
- You need a mechanism to filter and rank customers based on sales performance.

## Code

Below is a generic stored procedure that identifies customers whose total sales exceed a specified threshold. The procedure performs the following steps:

&nbsp;
### Steps in the procedure:
1. Clear the existing data in the `high_value_customers` table.
2. Insert new records based on a sales threshold (`total_sales_threshold`) defined when calling the procedure.
&nbsp;
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE identify_high_value_customers(IN total_sales_threshold INT)
BEGIN
    -- Step 1: Clear existing data
    TRUNCATE TABLE high_value_customers;

    -- Step 2: Insert high-value customers
    INSERT INTO high_value_customers (customer_id, customer_name, total_sales)
    SELECT 
        sales.customer_id, 
        customer.customer_name, 
        ROUND(SUM(sales.sale_value)) AS total_sales
    FROM 
        sales_data AS sales, 
        customers AS customer
    WHERE 
        sales.customer_id = customer.customer_id
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id, customer_name
    HAVING 
        total_sales > total_sales_threshold
    ORDER BY 
        total_sales DESC;
END
//
DELIMITER ;
```
&nbsp;
## Code Example
Hereâ€™s a real-world example where we want to identify customers who have made purchases totaling more than $1,000:


```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE SP_high_value_customers(IN min_sales INT)
BEGIN
    -- Step 1: Clear existing data
    TRUNCATE TABLE high_value_customers;

    -- Step 2: Find and insert high-value customers
    INSERT INTO high_value_customers (customer_id, customer_name, total_sales)
    SELECT 
        S.customer_id, 
        C.customer_name, 
        ROUND(SUM(S.sale_value)) AS total_sales
    FROM 
        sales_transactions AS S, 
        customer_list AS C
    WHERE 
        S.customer_id = C.customer_id
    GROUP BY 
        S.customer_id, C.customer_name
    HAVING 
        total_sales > min_sales
    ORDER BY 
        total_sales DESC;
END
//
DELIMITER ;

-- Call the procedure with a threshold of $1,000 in total sales
CALL SP_high_value_customers(1000);
```

In this example:

The procedure groups and sums the sales (sale_value) for each customer from the sales_transactions table.
Only customers whose total sales exceed the input threshold (min_sales) are inserted into the high_value_customers table.
The list is then ordered by total sales in descending order.

&nbsp;
## Notes
- The target table (e.g., high_value_customers) must already exist before running the procedure.
- Modify the table, column names and your query to suit your requirements.
- You can set up a scheduled event in MySQL to automatically refresh the table at regular intervals (e.g., daily, hourly), ensuring that your list of high-value customers is always up to date.

``` sql
CREATE EVENT update_high_value_customers
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
DO
CALL SP_high_value_customers(1000);
```
